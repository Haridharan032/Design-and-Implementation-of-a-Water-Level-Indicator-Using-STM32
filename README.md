# Experiment: Design and Implementation of a Water Level Indicator Using STM32

## Aim

To design and implement a **Water Level Indicator using STM32 Nucleo-L031K6** that measures the water level using an analog input and displays the water level as **LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH** on the Wokwi Serial Monitor.

---

## Components Required

- STM32 Nucleo-L031K6
- Potentiometer to simulate the water-level sensor
- Wokwi Simulator
- Virtual Serial Monitor
- Connecting wires

## Theory

A **Water Level Indicator** is used to monitor the amount of water present in a tank.

In this experiment, a **potentiometer** is used in Wokwi to simulate the output of a water-level sensor. The potentiometer produces an analog voltage between **0 V and 3.3 V**.

The analog signal is connected to the **PA0 ADC input** of the STM32 Nucleo-L031K6.

The STM32 contains a **12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**. Therefore, the analog input voltage is converted into a digital value between:

- **0** → Minimum water level
- **4095** → Maximum water level

The ADC value is converted into a percentage, and the water level is classified as:

- **LOW**
- **MEDIUM**
- **HIGH**

The water-level information is displayed on the **Wokwi Serial Monitor** using UART communication.

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Initialize the STM32 HAL library.
3. Configure the system clock.
4. Configure **PA0 as an analog input**.
5. Initialize ADC1.
6. Initialize USART2 for serial communication.
7. Read the analog value from the potentiometer.
8. Convert the ADC reading into water-level percentage.
9. Compare the percentage with predefined limits.
10. If the water level is less than or equal to 30%, display **LOW**.
11. If the water level is between 31% and 70%, display **MEDIUM**.
12. If the water level is greater than 70%, display **HIGH**.
13. Display the ADC value, water-level percentage, and status on the Serial Monitor.

## Working

The potentiometer produces an analog voltage that represents the water level in the tank.

The STM32 reads this analog voltage through the **PA0 ADC input**. Since the ADC has a **12-bit resolution**, the analog signal is converted into a digital value between **0 and 4095**.

The ADC value is converted into water-level percentage using:

`Water Level (%) = (ADC Value × 100) / 4095`

The STM32 then classifies the water level as:

- **0–30% → LOW**
- **31–70% → MEDIUM**
- **71–100% → HIGH**

The ADC value, percentage, and water-level status are transmitted through **USART2** and displayed on the **Wokwi Serial Monitor**.

---

## Result

Thus, the **Water Level Indicator using STM32 Nucleo-L031K6** was designed and implemented successfully. The water level was measured using the ADC and displayed as **LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH** on the Wokwi Serial Monitor.
